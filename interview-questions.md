# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: 
    Parameter is put into something such as a function, letting the developer know what type of data the user is going to be inputting into that function. The argument is the actual data that the user inputs into the console that is ran through the function, expecting an output.

  Researched answer: 
    A parameter is a placeholder inside a function that describes the variable that is going to be passed through the function. However, in javascript the definition used to describe your parameters does not check for or specify the data type that will be passed as the argument. They are placed inside of the parenthesis of the function and can contain multiple parameters separated by commas. The argument is the real values that the parameter variables are asking for inputted by the user and passed through the function when invoked.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: 
    The required parameter of .map() is that it can only loop through a array. The optional parameters is that the elements inside the array are not limited to a single data type. Examples of the data that can be evaluated by the .map() method are booleans, strings, and numbers which can all be mixed together inside the array. 

  Researched answer:
    I was a bit of on my first answer. The there are 3 pre-defined parameters which are the value, index, and array. The required parameter is the value because in order for .map() to work it needs at least one argument. Calling on a specific index is optional because as default .map() will iterate through the array starting at index 0. Also, putting another array inside of the parameter is optional broadening the possibilities that method can perform.





3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: 
    The method .map() iterates through an array returning a new array of the same length after it is invoked. While using .filter it will iterate through an array and pull out specified elements designated by the developer, returning them in new array.  

  Researched answer:
    .map() will iterate through each individual value in an array
